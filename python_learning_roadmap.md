# A Practical Learning Roadmap for Complete Beginners

### Step 0:

_Prerequisite:_

-   Zero programming experience / Complete beginners.

_Learning Material:_

Watch some awesome lecture videos from Harvard University CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (v2015) by David Malan.

1. [CS50: Week 0 Lecture](https://youtu.be/zFenJJtAEzE)
2. [CS50: Week 0 continued Lecture](https://youtu.be/UuFWYOnHwGM)

Just to watch this two lectures only, you should be able to get a grasp of what programming is, and be able to create your own Scratch (A graphical/ visual programming language) program. Of course, you can finish this course online as well if you found it interesting and useful.

### Step 1: Familiarise with Terminologies and Setup Your Development Environment

1.1 Some Terminologies

-   Compiler / Interpreter
-   Source Code / Machine Code
-   Python Module / Package / Library
-   Text Editors / IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    -   [Atom](https://atom.io) - A good text (and good-looking) editor
    -   [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) - A customisable text editor (require some effort to learn)
    -   [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - A customisable text editor
    -   [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) - A good (and good-looking) text editor
    -   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - A general Open Source IDE by Microsoft
    -   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - A Python IDE by IntelliJ
    -   [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) - A scientific Python IDE

1.2 Environment Set up

_What you need to do / know:_

-   Install python on your machine properly
-   Choose a text editor or an IDE as your main development tool
-   Know how to run python script from an IDE
-   Know how to run python script from a terminal / shell
-   Know how to use basic commands in Command Line Interface (CLI)
    -   Know how to navigate around directories in your file system
    -   Know how to open/ create / move files
