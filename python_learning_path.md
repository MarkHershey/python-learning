# Python Learning
#### A Practical Learning Path for Complete Beginners  

### Step 0:
*Prerequisite:*

- Zero programming experience / Complete beginners.

*Learning Material:*

Watch some awesome lecture videos from Harvard University CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (v2015) by David Malan.

1. [CS50: Week 0 Lecture](https://youtu.be/zFenJJtAEzE)
2. [CS50: Week 0 continued Lecture](https://youtu.be/UuFWYOnHwGM)

Just to watch this two lectures only, you should be able to get a grasp of what programming is, and be able to create your own Scratch (A graphical/ visual programming language) program. Of course, you can finish this course online as well if you found it interesting and useful.

### Step 1: Familiarise with Terminologies and Setup Your Development Environment
1.1 Some Terminologies

- Compiler / Interpreter
- Source Code / Machine Code
- Python Module / Package / Library
- Text Editors / IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    - [Atom](https://atom.io) - A good text (and good-looking) editor
    - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) - A customisable text editor (require some effort to learn)
    - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - A customisable text editor
    - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) - A good (and good-looking) text editor
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - A general Open Source IDE by Microsoft
    - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - A Python IDE by IntelliJ
    - [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) - A scientific Python IDE

1.2 Environment Set up
> for macOS user, you may follow to this guide: [How to Install Vanilla Python on macOS Properly?](docs/python-install-guide.md)

ML powered Auto Completion
- [TabNine](https://tabnine.com/)
- [kite](https://kite.com/)

Code Formatter
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

*Learning Objective:*

- Install python on your machine properly
- Know how to run python script from an IDE
- Know how to run python script from a terminal / shell
- Know how to use basic commands in Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - Know how to navigate around directories in your file system
    - Know how to open/ create / move files


>If you are a computer science/ computer engineering / robotics student:
>
>- Learn how to use command line interface (CLI): [How to use command line for UNIX-based system](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/)
>- Learn how to use Git and Github

### Step 2: Think Like a Computer Scientist

*Learning Material:*

Finish these book along with practices:

- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3 (Book):
[[Download PDF]](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/howtothink/latest/howtothink.pdf) / [[Read Online]](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)

*Learning Objective:*

- Python syntax
- Python basic built-in functions
- Object Oriented Programming


### Step 3: Deep Dive into Python's Built-in Libraries
